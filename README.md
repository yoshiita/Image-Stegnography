# Steganography

**_Hide text messages in images_**

## Description
Image Steganography refers to the process of hiding data within an image file. The image selected for this purpose is called the cover image and the image obtained after steganography is called the stego image.
(**TL;DR :** _This program can hide a text message in an image, which can only
be decoded by this program only._)

Steganography can be divided into two types:

1. Spatial domain transformation:
   - **LSB** (Least Significant Bit) transformation.
2. Frequency domain transformation:
   - **DCT** (Discrete Cosine Transformation).
   - **DWT** (Discrete Wavelet Transformation).
